\section{Data preprocessing}
We partition the data into 16 portions, and one portion is taken out as the test data. In each iteration, we take one portion out of the other 15 portions in turn as the validation data, and train our model on the rest 14 portions.

Due to camera capture range limitations, we empirically found that a spacial cube of 960mm each side in front of the camera is sufficient to contain all valid data. An axis-aligned cube of 240mm each side with the same centre as calculated from all joints is a good range for cropping out hand range.

\section{Training}
We train maximum 10 epochs, but will break the program early when validation loss is growing (10\% higher than the last epoch). \footnote{The model is only saved when validation loss decrease.}
