"perspective distortion" problem could be solved using orthogonal projection, which also a key point that leads to success of "orth3view".

final prediction consensus: using weighted average.

use unit offset:
 - numerical stability
 - consistent with probability, remove redundancy
 - computation is also easier: weight sum needs distance anyway
